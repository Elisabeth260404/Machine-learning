                                              Q & A's 

DEFINE THE LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL: 
1. Why is linear regression an appropriate starting point for this biological question? 
2. What assumptions are we making about the relationship between methylation levels and age?

PROCESSTHE DATA WITH A RECIPE:
3. What other preprocessing steps might be helpful when working with methylation data? 
4. Would scaling (standardising) the predictors also be beneficial? Why or why not?

FIT THE MODEL:
5. What is actually happening when we ‚Äúfit‚Äù a linear regression model to methylation data? 
6. What are we trying to do?

EVALUATE THE MODLE:
7. Which CpG sites appear most important for predicting age? 
8. Are there any that don‚Äôt seem significantly associated with age?

PERFORMANCE METRICS: 
9. What would be an acceptable error margin for age prediction in your biological context? 
10. How might this compare to other methods of age determination in bats?

CHECK MODEL ASSUMPTIONS: 
11. What assumptions does linear regression make, and do our model diagnostics suggest these assumptions are met? 
12. Look particularly at: 
    - Linearity (do residuals show patterns?) 
    - Homoscedasticity (is residual variance constant across predicted values?) 
    - Normality of residuals 
    - Influential outliers

CHALLENGE - IMPROVE THE MODEL: 
ü§î Stop and Think: 
13. Based on our diagnostics, what specific improvements might help our model? 
14. What biological mechanisms might explain non-linear relationships between methylation and age?
