                                              Q & A's 

DEFINE THE LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL: 
1. Why is linear regression an appropriate starting point for this biological question? 
2. What assumptions are we making about the relationship between methylation levels and age?

PROCESSTHE DATA WITH A RECIPE:
3. What other preprocessing steps might be helpful when working with methylation data? 
4. Would scaling (standardising) the predictors also be beneficial? Why or why not?

FIT THE MODEL:
5. What is actually happening when we “fit” a linear regression model to methylation data? 
6. What are we trying to do?

EVALUATE THE MODLE:
7. Which CpG sites appear most important for predicting age? 
8. Are there any that don’t seem significantly associated with age?

PERFORMANCE METRICS: 
9. What would be an acceptable error margin for age prediction in your biological context? 
10. How might this compare to other methods of age determination in bats?

CHECK MODEL ASSUMPTIONS: 
11. What assumptions does linear regression make, and do our model diagnostics suggest these assumptions are met? 
12. Look particularly at: 
    - Linearity (do residuals show patterns?) 
    - Homoscedasticity (is residual variance constant across predicted values?) 
    - Normality of residuals 
    - Influential outliers

TRAINING AND TESTING SETS: 
13. Why is it important to evaluate our model on a separate test set? What might happen if we only evaluated performance on our training data? 
14. How does the performance on the test set compare to the training set? If there’s a large difference, what might that indicate? 

CROSS-VALIDATION PERFORMANCE: 
15. What advantages does cross-validation offer over a single train/test split? How consistent are the results across folds? 

EXPLORING DIFFERENT FOLD NUMBERS: 
16. How does the number of folds affect the stability and value of the performance metrics? 
17. What tradeoffs are involved in choosing a higher or lower number of folds? 

FINAL MODLE EVALUATION:
18. What improvements would make this model more useful for real-world biological applications? 
19. What additional data would strengthen the model’s reliability? 

REGULARISED REGRESSION: RIDGE AND LASSO: 
20. What does the mixture = 1 parameter mean? How would the model change if we set it to 0? 
21. When would you prefer Ridge over Lasso for methylation data analysis? Consider the biological meaning of correlated CpG sites.
